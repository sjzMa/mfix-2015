Changes from MFIX 2015-1 (Date: 04/03/2014) to MFIX 2015-2 (Date: 10/27/2015)


New features added:
-------------------

* Autotools Build System ¿ MFIX now uses autotools to configure and
  compile the code. This increases code portability while reducing
  overall script maintenance.

* Semi-Explicit Coupling for DEM Simulation ¿ A semi-explicit algorithm
  for coupled gas-solids flows was implemented in MFIX-DEM. This
  approach calculates gas-solids interaction forces during the gas phase
  time step resulting in decreased time to solution.

* Two New Continuum Momentum Equation Formulations ¿ MFIX¿s governing
  equations were not consistent with either of the primary recognized
  form of the governing equations.

  o The Jackson form of the governing equations contains the void
    fraction as a multiplier in front of the divergence of the gas phase
    stress tensor in the gas phase momentum equation and includes the
    solids volume fraction multiplied by the gas phase stress tensor in
    the solids phase momentum equation.
    Invoked using keyword Jackson.

  o The Ishii form of the governing equation includes the void fraction 
    as a multiplier within the divergence term of the stress tensor. 
    Invoked using keyword Ishii.


Changes in existing features:
-----------------------------

* Removed DES_CONTINUUM_COUPLED keyword ¿ Pure granular flow simulations
  with MFIX-DEM and MFIX-PIC are now specified by setting the gas 
  density to zero (RO_g0=0.0) making them consistent with MFIX-TFM.
  Coupled gas-solids simulation occur by specifying a non-zero or 
  compressible gas phase density.

* Removed DES_RES_DT and DES_SPX_DT ¿Pure granular flows simulations
  with MFIX-DEM and MFIX-PIC now use the same restart and data output
  keywords, RES_DT and SPX_DT. This makes specifying these values
  consistent across all models and simulation setups.
